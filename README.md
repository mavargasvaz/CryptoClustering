# CryptoClustering

# Objetive:

## Predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Main Task:

### Prepare the Data:

Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

### Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
Use the elbow method to find the best value for k using the following steps:

What is the best value for k? Best Value according to our resulst is  4

### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means
## Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

### Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data 

What is the best value for k? Best Value according to our resulst is  4

## Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data 

## Visualize and Compare the Results
